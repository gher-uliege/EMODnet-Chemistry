# Processing

The goal of this tutorial is to explain how to processing the residuals
obtained with `DIVAnd` using `Ocean Data View` (ODV).

In this example:
* __File:__ `Water body phosphate_monthly_residuals.nc` (monthly residuals of
	phosphate concentration).
* __ODV version:__ 5.4.0 (downloaded March 2021)


## Procedure

### 1. Open the netCDF file containing the residuals

![Open file](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res01.png "Open file")

### 2. Follow the _Wizard_ steps

![Dimensions](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res02.png "Dimensions")

![Metadata](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res03.png "Metadata")

#### Use decimal date (or dummy variable) as _Primary variable_
![Primary variable](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res04.png "Primary variable")

#### Finish the netCDF setup
![netCDF setup](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res05.png "netCDF setup")

### 3. Select a _SURFACE Window_ in _Views/Layout Templates_

![Surface window](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res06.png "Surface window")

Result of the _Surface Window_. Here you can change the dot size (in _Properties_) and other details according to your preferences.

### 4. Set the z-variable as the residuals

![z-variable](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res08.png "z-variable")

Set the ranges for the residuals, for instance between -5. and 5.

![Set range](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res10.png "Set range")
![Set range](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res11.png "Set range")

### 5. Use the sample filter to display only the points with a high value for the residual

#### For example we show residuals above 5
![Filter display](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res12.png "Filter display")

#### Example of what is obtained with the filter
![Display residuals](../figures/ODV-residuals/odv_res13.png "Display residuals")

### 6. Select your region of interest using the _Set ranges_ tool
In this case we can see the measurements in the _Black Sea_ for which the residuals exceed a concentration of 5 Âµmol/l.

## Post-processing

### Starting with a CSV file

The goal is to obtain a list of identifier (`obsid`) that will be black-listed
for the next round of analysis. We can either store the identifiers (only), or
keep also the other variables (position, time, depth) if we don't want to remove a whole
profile.

Starting from a CSV file, it is straightforward to work with `awk`:

* To list identifiers for which the residuals is above a given value
```bash
awk -F "," '$7 > 50.0 {print $5}' inputfile > blacklist.txt
```

* To list identifiers of the data that have been excluded (last column set to __1__):
```bash
awk -F "," '$8 == 1 {print $5}' inputfile > excludelist.txt
```

* If we need to combine several conditions (`||` = or; `&&` = and):
```bash
awk -F "," '($7 > 150.0) || ($7 < -115.) { print $5}' inputfile > excludelist.txt
```

__Notes:__

- In some cases, the separator can be the semicolon `;`.`
- If we want to print more than one column:
```bash
awk -F  ";" '$8 == 1 {print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5}' inputfile > excludelist.txt
```

### Starting with a netCDF file

One can directly use the output file produced by `DIVAnd` and storing the residuals (ex: `)


### User notes

#### Arctic

Files for all the variables, except DIN, were prepared by the regional leader.

Note that the order of the column is slightly different.
(print $2, $3, $5, $1, $4)

#### Atlantic
Phosphate, silicate and nitrogen were prepared by the regional leader.

* Oxygen:
> Remove data for which residuals > 150 and < -115.

* Chlorophyll:
> exclude points with residuals > 50

#### Baltic Sea
All the variables were processed by the regional leader and the files sent to us.

#### Black Sea
Same.
